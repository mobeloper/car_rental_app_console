    "\n",
    "A car rental company has requested you to develop an online platform for renting cars where customers can easily view the cars available for rental on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. The company will show the current inventory and verify requests by checking the available stock. Upon returning the car, customers will receive an automatically generated bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, letâ€™s assume that:\n",
    "1.    Customers may rent cars using one of the following options: hourly, daily, or weekly rental.\n",
    "2.    Customers can freely choose the number of cars they wish to rent as long as the quantity of available cars exceeds their requested amount."
